      <h2>Managing resources</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>In programming, the usage of limited resources like files or database connections is quite common</li>
        <li>Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage.</li>
        <li>If not released, it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash</li>
        <li>This could be overcome by context managers which supports proper handling of resources</li>
      </ul>
