Plot
See also: Baahubali: The Beginning § Plot
Kattappa (Sathyaraj) continues to narrate how he ended up killing Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas).

After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of Mahishmati and Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati) is declared as the commander-in-chief. Before the coronation, Rajamatha Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) begins to look for a bride for Amarendra. She instructs Amarendra and Kattappa to tour the kingdom to understand its current state and its people.

Amarendra falls in love with Devasena (Anushka Shetty), a princess of the Kuntala kingdom (7.5 yojanas in the North from Mahishmati) and the sister of the king of Kuntala. Bhallaladeva learns of Amarendra's attempts to woo Devasena and hatches a plot to drive a wedge between Amarendra and Sivagami by asking for Devasena's hand in marriage for himself. Sivagami, unaware that Amarendra is in love with Devasena, promises Devasena's hand in marriage to Bhallaladeva.

Sivagami sends an emissary to the kingdom of Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronizing way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Sivagami is enraged to hear Devasena's response and sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.

The kingdom of Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal uncle, Kumara Varma (Subbaraju), is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Amarendra reveals who he is, promises Devasena that he will protect her honor no matter what and convinces her to come with him to Mahismati as his future bride.

Upon reaching Mahismati, the misunderstanding comes to light. When Sivagami delivers an ultimatum to Amarendra that he must either chose the throne or Devasena, he chooses Devasena. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During the coronation ceremony the citizens of Mahishmati clearly display their preference for Amarendra over Bhallaladeva.

At Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva relieves Amarendra of his duties as commander-in-chief so that Amarendra can be with his wife. Devasena immediately speaks out against the King's manipulation and the mute inaction of Sivagami. Due to further clashes, Devasena and Amarendra are banished from the Palace. Amarendra and Devasena live happily among the people. Bhallaladeva notices that to the people, Amarendra is their king, and hatches a plot with his father Bijjaladeva (Nassar) to convince Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat and open action would result in factions and civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.

Kattappa learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami. Devasena too arrives to learn of her husband's death with her son, in her arms. Sivagami announces the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, is the new King.

As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with baby Mahendra Baahubali. Devasena is taken prisoner for the next 25 years. The Kuntala Kingdom is destroyed completely by Bhallaladeva. The now ousted Kuntala King (Meka Ramakrishna), leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against king Bhallaladeva.

After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali alias Shivudu (Prabhas) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika (Tamannaah) and the people of the city. Bhallaladeva once again kidnaps Devasena and seals the palace, but Baahubali, ingenious like his father, manages to enter the palace to capture Bhallaladeva.

Bijjala Deva tries to brainwash Kattappa reminding him of his forefather's pledge of their allegiance to protect and defend the throne of Mahismati and their duty to be loyal to the king. Kattappa reminds him that Sivagami had declared Mahendra Baahubali king before her death 25 years back and hence his loyalties instead lie with the rightful king, Baahubali. Bhallaladeva is later defeated by Baahubali and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena. Ending the cruel regime of Bhallaladeva, Baahubali becomes the new King of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen, declaring peace and harmony.

In the end credits, a child is heard asking an elder whether the son of Mahendra Baahubali will become the next king of Mahishmati. To which, the elder replies: "Who knows what Lord Shiva is planning!"

Prabhas was cast as main lead of the film. Anushka Shetty was cast as the heroine of the film as she was also a part of Mirchi (2013).[21] She coincidentally became the first heroine Rajamouli repeated in his films and thus made her schedules full for 2013 and 2014.[22] Rana Daggubati was recruited as the antagonist of the film and coincidentally he was also a part of Rudhramadevi.[23] Sathyaraj signed the film.[24]

In April 2013, Adivi Sesh was cast for a crucial role in the film as Rajamouli was impressed by his work in the Panjaa (2011).[25] Actress Ramya Krishnan was chosen to play the crucial role in the film as Rajamatha in August 2013.[26] Actor Nassar was selected to play a supporting role.[26] Charandeep was selected to play the brother of the film's chief villain.[27] On 20 December 2013 a press release stated that Tamannaah will be second heroine of the film which marks her first collaboration with Rajamouli and second collaboration with Prabhas.[28] Meka Ramakrishna was picked for the head of the Kuntala guerillas.

Characters and looks
Rana Daggubati was said to be playing the role of Prabhas' brother and he too underwent a lot of physical transformation satisfying the role he was assigned to play in the film.[23] He also underwent training in Martial arts under the supervision of a Vietnamese trainer, Tuan.[29] Sathyaraj has a Tonsured look for his role in the film.[30] Sudeep said that he would play the role of a weapons trader Aslam Khan in this film.[31] In the end of October 2013, Rana appeared at a fashion show with a beefed up body which, according to him, was a part of his look in the film.[32] In mid-May 2014, reports emerged that Anushka would play a pregnant woman for a few sequences in the second part of the film.[33]

At the same time, Prabhas posted on his Facebook page that he underwent a minor shoulder surgery and would join the film's sets in a span of a month.[34] On 1 June 2014, Prabhas and Rana's trainer Lakshman Reddy, said that Prabhas started his training 8 months before the commencement of shooting and after two years, both of them weighed nearly 100 kilos each. He also added that Prabhas has two attires with a heavy, bulky body for Baahubali's role and a lean physique for the second role.[35] For his look, Prabhas met WWE superstars like The Undertaker in February 2014 and interacted with them about their daily regimen and workouts.[36]

Prabhas had equipment costing ₹15 million shipped to his home, where he built a personal gym. His breakfast included 40 half-boiled egg whites blended and added with protein powder.[36] In mid-June 2014, regarding her role in the film, Tamannaah said that she would be playing the role of a warrior princess named Avanthika and her appearance in the film is completely different when compared to her past films.[37][38] Before joining the film's shoot, Tamannaah did costume trials for the film which she confirmed in her micro-blogging page stating "I am very excited to get on to the set of Baahubali. I did some dress trials today and my look in this movie will be totally new. I have never been seen in such sort of a look till now.

Critical reception

The film received positive reviews from critics and audience.[78] Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave an 4/5 rating and called it "a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart". He also stated, "This production’s triumph is the room it’s granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion. Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness, perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action, and love in action. The budget’s big, the muscle considerable, but they’re nothing compared with Baahubali’''s heart."[79]

Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and wrote, "Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is everything I want, but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movies". He further said, "The fight scenes in "Baahubali 2 are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel, everything from computer-generated imagery (CGI) to speed-ramping (Zack Snyder's signature technique of speeding up, then slowing down, then speeding up the tempo of a particularly action or physical motion). You care what happens to the cast as they, aided by wires, hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions, and CGI animals. You haven't seen action scenes with physics and logic-defying choreography like this before." He also noted "Many American viewers may wonder how a film that received little to no media coverage could surpass The Circle, a new studio-produced and distributed thriller starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, at the US box office. But they have to see it to know why."[80]

Rachit Gupta from Filmfare gave the film a rating of 4.5/5, stating, "SS Rajamouli's much awaited sequel is the kind of movie Indian cinema should make regularly. It’s the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve. It’s the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI, this film is possible the greatest spectacle you'll see on a big screen, in your life."[81] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from The Hindu stated, "For the most part, The Conclusion doesn't let us take our eyes off the screen. It's designed to be a cinematic celebration, one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible".[82] Hemanth Kumar from Firstpost called it "Rajamouli's epic drama" and rated it 4/5.[83] Dipanjan Sinha of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars, praising the film's cinematography and special effects, but found fault with some of the female characters. Sinha stated, "Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected."[84] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express rated the film 2/5 stars, noting problems with pacing and sound.[85]

Meena Iyer from The Times of India rated it 4/5, writing: "Just savour it. It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son. Of course it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat."[86] Sukanya Verma from Rediff rated the film 3.5/5, writing, "Baahubali: The Conclusion continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude. Except this time, high drama, more than spectacle, is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry."[87] She also praised the film's cast and director stating, "Equipped with a cast that’s not only in tune with Rajamouli's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali’s might."[87]

Anupama Subramanian of the Deccan Chronicle gave the film a 3.5/5, saying "Prabhas steals the show with his awe-inspiring persona."[88]
